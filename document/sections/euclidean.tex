\section{Setting}

Throughout this note the symbol $ \mathbb{E} $
will denote a fixed Euclidean space of dimension $ d \geq 2 $.
The space $ \mathbb{E} $ will be treated as an affine space.
Points from $ \mathbb{E} $ are typically
denoted by $ p , q $ and vectors by $ v, u $.
The vector pointing from $ p $ to $ q $ is denoted as $ q - p $.
The scalar product of two vectors $ v $ and $ u $ from $ \mathbb{E} $
will be denoted as $ \skap{ v }{ u } $.

The letter $ F $ will denote an infinitely differentiable function
with the property that $ \grad{F}( p ) \neq 0 $ whenever $ F( p ) = 0 $.
Thus, by the implicit function theorem the set
\begin{align}
    M  :=  \{ p \in \mathbb{E} : F( p ) = 0 \}
\end{align}
can be understood as an infinitely differentiable manifold.
